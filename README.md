# Encryption Tool

üõ°Ô∏è Welcome to the Encryption Tool! This Python-based application provides various encryption algorithms to secure your plaintext messages. It supports multiple cipher techniques, including additive, multiplicative, affine, monoalphabetic substitution, autokey, playfair, vigen√®re, and more.

## Features

- **Additive Cipher**: Simple shift cipher using a key.
- **Multiplicative Cipher**: A cipher that requires a coprime key with 26.
- **Affine Cipher**: Combines additive and multiplicative ciphers with two keys.
- **Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher**: Substitutes letters based on a provided key.
- **Autokey Cipher**: Uses a keyword to encrypt the plaintext.
- **Playfair Cipher**: Placeholder for the Playfair cipher implementation.
- **Vigen√®re Cipher**: Uses a keyword for encryption based on letter shifts.
- **Keyless and Keyed Transposition Ciphers**: Placeholders for future implementations.
- **Double Transposition Cipher**: Placeholder for future implementations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
